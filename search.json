I am passionate about the R programming language, Linux and other free and open-source software (FOSS).\nIf you happen to work for the State of Connecticut, you can often find me presenting or helping out with our inter-agency R User Group.\nDuring my almost 7 years in public health I’ve worked with my colleagues to tackle the opioid epidemic in Connecticut, expand the use of near-realtime syndromic surveillance, and helped bring automated daily and weekly reporting to DPH and to the public through our Open Data Portal."
