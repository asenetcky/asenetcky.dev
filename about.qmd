I am a Data Scientist and an Epidemiologist. I am passionate about the R 
programming language, Linux and other free and open-source software (FOSS). 
I both enjoy and strive to bring many of the amazing qualities that encompass 
FOSS to my little neck of the woods in state government. It is my hope to make 
the data we use for decision making, and all of its related tooling more open 
and reproducible.
