I am a Data Scientist and an Epidemiologist currently working for
Connecticut Department of Public Health (DPH). I am passionate about the R 
programming language, Linux and other free and open-source software (FOSS). 

If you happen to work for the State of Connecticut, you can often
find me presenting or helping out with our inter-agency 
[R_User Group](https://github.com/CTOpenData/r-user-group).

During my 7 years in public health I've worked with my colleagues
to tackle the opioid epidemic in Connecticut, expand the use of near-realtime
syndromic surveillance, and helped bring automated daily and weekly reporting
to DPH and to the public through our [Open Data Portal](https://data.ct.gov/).
