# distiller

`distiller` is my R-package I wrote to help me submit data to CDC's 
[Environmental Public Health Tracking](https://www.cdc.gov/environmental-health-tracking/about/index.html).  
This package will take your wrangled data and create the XML documents as 
required by the CDC specification.  Check it out and please let me know if it 
helps ease your submissions.

You can find `distiller` documentation [here](https://asenetcky.github.io/distiller/).
