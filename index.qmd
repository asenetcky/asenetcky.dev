Hello, I'm Alex Senetcky. I love working with and teaching open source
data-focused tools and programming languages. I'm a father who loves camping, 
woodworking, computer hardware and making manual espresso - and all the 
other gear that goes along with coffee brewing at home! You're in the 
right place if you want to learn more [about me](about.qmd) and my work.
This website is a work in progress so please be sure to come back 
and check for new content and updates while I tidy up.
