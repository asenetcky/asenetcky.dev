Hello, I'm Alexander Senetcky. 
You're in the right place if you want to learn more 
[about me](about.qmd) and my work.

I love working with and teaching open source data-focused tools 
and programming languages. I'm a father who loves camping, 
woodworking, computer hardware and making manual espresso - and all the 
other gear that goes along with coffee brewing at home! 


This website is a work in progress so please be sure to come back 
and check for new content and updates while I tidy up.
